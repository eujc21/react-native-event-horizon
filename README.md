# Event Horizon - React Native

Event Horizon is an application architecture that for building client-side web applications. It is similar to the Redux system except Event Horizon uses Tracker dependent variables like `ReactiveVar`. There are no more `Reducers` no more `Trunking` any async callback functions and no more how do i get my data into it. Storing your application's UI state in Event Horizon allows for dispatchments to open and close modals, submit forms, and event what direction to sort a table.

### Version
